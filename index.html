        <section id="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The widespread use of the Internet in the 1990s introduced a new challenge for software engineers—designing and implementing systems that were secure. As more
and more systems were connected to the Internet, a variety of different external
attacks were devised to threaten these systems. The problems of producing dependable systems were hugely increased. Systems engineers had to consider threats from
malicious and technically skilled attackers as well as problems resulting from accidental mistakes in the development process.</p>
                <p>It is now essential to design systems to withstand external attacks and to recover from
such attacks. Without security precautions, it is almost inevitable that attackers will compromise a networked system. They may misuse the system hardware, steal confidential
data, or disrupt the services offered by the system. System security engineering is therefore an increasingly important aspect of the systems engineering process.</p>
                <p>Security engineering is concerned with the development and evolution of systems
that can resist malicious attacks, which are intended to damage the system or its data.
Software security engineering is part of the more general field of computer security.
This has become a priority for businesses and individuals as more and more criminals try to exploit networked systems for illegal purposes. Software engineers should
be aware of the security threats faced by systems and ways in which these threats can
be neutralized.</p>
                <p>My intention in this chapter is to introduce security engineering to software engineers, with a focus on design issues that affect application security. The chapter is
not about computer security as a whole and so doesn’t cover topics such as encryption, access control, authorization mechanisms, viruses and Trojan horses, etc. These
are described in detail in general texts on computer security (Anderson, 2008;
Bishop, 2005; Pfleeger and Pfleeger, 2007).</p>
                <p>The majority of external attacks focus on system infrastructures because infrastructure components (e.g., web browsers) are well known and widely available.
Attackers can probe these systems for weaknesses and share information about vulnerabilities that they have discovered. As many people use the same software,
attacks have wide applicability. Infrastructure vulnerabilities may lead to attackers
gaining unauthorized access to an application system and its data.
In practice, there is an important distinction between application security and
infrastructure security:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Application security is a software engineering problem where software engineers should ensure that the system is designed to resist attacks.</li>
                        <li>Infrastructure security is a management problem where system managers configure the infrastructure to resist attacks. System managers have to set up the
infrastructure to make the most effective use of whatever infrastructure security</li>
                    </ol>
features are available. They also have to repair infrastructure security vulnerabilities that come to light as the software is used.</li></ol>
                <p>System security management is not a single task but includes a range of activities
such as user and permission management, system software deployment and maintenance, and attack monitoring, detection and recovery:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>User and permission management includes adding and removing users from the
system, ensuring that appropriate user authentication mechanisms are in place
and setting up the permissions in the system so that users only have access to the
resources that they need.</li>
                        <li>System software deployment and maintenance includes installing system software and middleware and configuring these properly so that security vulnerabilities are avoided. It also involves updating this software regularly with new
versions or patches, which repair security problems that have been discovered.</li>
                        <li>Attack monitoring, detection and recovery includes activities which monitor the
system for unauthorized access, detect, and put in place strategies for resisting
attacks, and backup activities so that normal operation can be resumed after an
external attack.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Security management is vitally important, but it is not usually considered to be part of application security engineering. Rather, application security engineering is concerned with designing a system so that it is as secure as possible, given budget
and usability constraints. Part of this process is ‘design for management’, where you
design systems to minimize the chance of security management errors leading to
successful attacks on the system. For critical control systems and embedded systems, it is normal practice to
select an appropriate infrastructure to support the application system. For example, embedded system developers usually choose a real-time operating system
that provides the embedded application with the facilities that it needs. Known
vulnerabilities and security requirements can be taken into account. This means
that an holistic approach can be taken to security engineering. Application security requirements may be implemented through the infrastructure or the application itself.
However, application systems in an organization are usually implemented using
the existing infrastructure (operating system, database, etc.). Therefore, the risks of
using that infrastructure and its security features must be taken into account as part
of the system design process.</p>
